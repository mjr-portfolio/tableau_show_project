## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project explores monthly help desk performance using Tableau. It focuses on resolution efficiency, support load, and agent-level trends. The dashboard is designed to provide HR and IT managers with at-a-glance insight into team workload and service delivery.

The data was pre-structured, allowing a focus on dashboard layout, interactivity, and stakeholder clarity.
